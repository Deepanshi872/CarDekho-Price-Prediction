# CarDekho-Price-Prediction
<br>
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that predicts the selling price of a used car based on its features. The model will help sellers price their cars accurately, enabling quicker sales and optimizing the pricing structure in the used car market. It will also assist buyers in identifying competitively priced vehicles, making the entire market more efficient.
<br>

# Problem Statement
The used car market in India is dynamic and constantly changing. Car prices can fluctuate widely depending on several factors such as the make and model of the car, its mileage, condition, and other market conditions. This variability makes it difficult for sellers to accurately price their cars, potentially leading to underpricing or overpricing.
<br>
# Dataset
The model will be trained using a dataset containing details of used cars listed on CarDekho.com. The dataset includes the following features:

-car_name: Name or title of the car (includes model or variant).
<br>
-brand: The manufacturer or brand of the car (e.g., Toyota, Honda).
<br>
-model: Specific model of the car.
<br>
-vehicle_age: Age of the vehicle in years.
<br>
-km_driven: Total kilometers driven by the car.
<br>
-seller_type: Type of seller (e.g., individual or dealer).
<br>
-fuel_type: Type of fuel used (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric).
<br>
-transmission_type: Type of transmission (e.g., manual, automatic).
<br>
-mileage: Fuel efficiency of the car in km/l.
<br>
-engine: Engine size or capacity in liters.
<br>
-max_power: Maximum power produced by the engine (in horsepower).
<br>
-seats: Number of seats in the car.
<br>
-selling_price: Target variable, representing the price of the car.
<br>

# Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a used car based on the features listed above. This model will assist in:
<br>
-Accurately pricing cars: Helping sellers price their cars more competitively and attractively.
<br>
-Making informed buying decisions: Assisting buyers in evaluating car prices based on historical data.
<br>
-Improving the efficiency of the used car market: By providing a data-driven, transparent pricing mechanism.
<br>

# Approach

<br>
1. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (if any).
Encode categorical variables such as brand, fuel_type, seller_type.
Normalize or standardize numerical features like vehicle_age, km_driven, mileage, etc.
<br>
2. Feature Engineering
Transform or create new features if necessary (e.g., derive vehicle_age from the manufacturing year).
Extract valuable information from features like car_name (e.g., model year, variant).
<br>
3. Model Selection
Experiment with various machine learning models such as:
Linear Regression
Evaluate models based on performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
<br>
4. Model Evaluation and Tuning
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
<br>
5. Prediction and Deployment
Once the model is trained and tuned, it will predict the price of a used car based on input features.
The model can be deployed as part of a web application for real-time price prediction.
